1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Ans. a) It can help find typos and syntax errors
     b) It can help in comparing code from different sources

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans. a) I won't have to think of what I deleted by mistake
     b) In a situation where I got something working first time and them broke it while trying to improve
     upon it, I can go to the earlier version

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Ans. a) The number of commits can be controlled
     b) We can decide exact change after which to commit
     c) Might forget to commit

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans. This is a feature that is specific to requirements of coding. We usually have file that are related to each other
     while coding.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans. navigate to the directory which is the repository to run git log
     git diff <earlier of the two commits id> <latest of the two commits id>

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Ans. I have no fear of loosing something that is already done! I can always get back to it. Time to focus on the next step...

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Ans. I still don't know how to make a directory a repo!
