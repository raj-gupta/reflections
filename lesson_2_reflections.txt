1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans. It create a .git sub directory and basically enables us to use that directory as a git repository with
no commits as of now. So that we can use the directory as a Git Repository!

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans. Files in working directory are not tracked and hence they won't feature in a commit while those in staging area will.
Repository contains files that are committed and staging area has those that are to be committed.
